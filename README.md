# Paidy Data Lake PoC

This repository contains code representation for production instances of azure data factory and azure synapse analytics services.

Unfortunately, since it was challenging to find stable internet during my travels in Turkey and allocate a bit more time, I was forced to take some shortcuts. 
I meant to build a full-fledged data lake using AWS. But I couldn't get past one error with AWS Glue Crawler for which I couldn't find solution on the internet.
After struggling with AWS I decided to go with Azure and registered a free account with 200$ credits. 
There were some constraints with DevOps side, therefore I couldn't build and provide a codebase for CI/CD backbone of my data lake. 

I can explain my thought process and explain my PoC in more details in our next call.
